    <h3>What are the Tacos Al Pastor?</h3>
    <p>a taco made with spit-grilled pork.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>30 Grams Guajillo Chiles clean and without seeds about 4 chilies</li>
        <li>30 grams of achiote paste30 grams of achiote paste</li>
        <li>¼ cup pineapple juice can use juices from canned pineapple slices</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Mexican oregano</li>
        <li>1 ¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>Corn tortillas</li>
        <li>Medium sized white onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chiles in a pot and cover with water. Simmer over medium heat for about 15 minutes or until soft. Let them cool and finally remove the water.</li>
        <li>Place the chiles, the vinegar, the pineapple juice with the spices and the achiote paste in the blender. Blend until a very smooth sauce forms. I poured the sauce slowly through a fine sieve to get a nice smooth texture. At that point, you can taste the sauce just to make sure the salt is enough for your liking.</li>
        <li>Season the meat with salt and pepper. Place sauce and fillets in a large bowl, marinate meat or use pastry brush to brush sauce on each side of fillets.v</li>
        <li>Place the meat on the vertical rotisserie, prepare the meat by inserting some slices of onion and pineapple. Let the marinade drain for about 20 minutes before starting to cook on the rotisserie. 1 hour is enough to cook 1 kilo of meat. Once cooked, cut the meat with a sharp knife and place it in a hot pan to give it that golden flavor as they do in taquerias in Mexico.</li>
        <li>Cut the meat finely and make your tacos with hot tortillas, topped with chopped onion, cilantro, pineapple and finally a sauce of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
